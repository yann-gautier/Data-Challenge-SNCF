# Data-Challenge-SNCF
A competitive machine learning project

## Getting started
If you ever open the project:
- Create your own file within the repository (or your own folder if you prefer a more structured architecture).
  You can use either a Jupyter notebook or a Python script.
- Add an `input` folder (if it doesn’t already exist) containing the data locally.
- Feel free to reuse parts of other people’s code if sections of the pipeline are the same, but make sure to contribute new ideas as well.

## Current benchmark
0.7545 achieved with a very basic regressor trained on delay data + categorical features encoded as integers (a mathematical oddity).

## Goal
We should be able to lower this to around 0.65 eventually.
